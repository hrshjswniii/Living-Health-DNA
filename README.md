🧬 Living Health DNA (LHD)
Your Health. Not Records. A Living DNA.

Living Health DNA (LHD) is a **patient-owned, AI-powered healthcare platform** that transforms fragmented medical records into a **lifelong, evolving health timeline**.  
Instead of reacting to illness, LHD focuses on **predicting health risks early** while ensuring **privacy, ownership, and consent-first data access**.


🚀 Vision

By 2050, people won’t frequently *visit hospitals*.  
Hospitals will **request access to your health timeline** — temporarily, securely, and only with your permission.

Living Health DNA shifts healthcare:
- From **static reports → living timelines**
- From **diagnosis → prediction**
- From **institution-owned data → patient-owned health intelligence**



🧠 Core Features

🔹 Living Health Timeline
- Continuous health data evolution over time  
- Combines wearables, reports, and lab results  
- Designed for long-term trend analysis, not snapshots  

🔹 AI Health Intelligence
- Builds a personalized health baseline  
- Detects deviations and early risk patterns  
- Generates predictive insights years before symptoms appear  

🔹 Patient-Owned Data Control
- Granular, permission-based data sharing  
- Time-bound access for doctors and specialists  
- Full revocation available at any moment  

🔹 Privacy-First Architecture
- Encrypted data storage  
- No permanent data sharing  
- Doctors see **approved insights only**, not raw data  



🧩 System Workflow (High Level)

1. Patient signs up and connects health sources  
2. Health data is securely ingested and encrypted  
3. AI builds a living health baseline and monitors trends  
4. Predictive insights are generated  
5. Patient grants temporary access when required  
6. Doctor views approved insights  
7. Access automatically expires or can be revoked
